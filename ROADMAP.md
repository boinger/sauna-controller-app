# Roadmap

The prioritized feature roadmap lives in the ESP32 firmware repo:
https://github.com/boinger/sauna-controller-esp32/blob/main/ROADMAP.md

The roadmap covers the full system (firmware + app) in one place to keep priorities aligned. App-specific work items are tagged there rather than tracked separately, so both repos stay in sync.
